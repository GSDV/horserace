# Horserace
Horserace is a fun game that supports a variety of bets. Instead of playing with real cards, this project can simulate the game for you at different speeds.

## Setup
Simply run
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/GSDV/horserace.git
 ```
and open the index.html file!

## How to Play
1) Choose an ace card.
2) Each time a card from the stack on the right flips, the suit shown will push the ace of the same suit up one row.
3) Once all aces either pass or are on a certain row, the card on the left will be flipped and the suit shown will push the ace of the same suit down one row.
4) First ace to cross the finish line wins!
